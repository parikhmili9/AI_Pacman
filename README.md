# AI_Pacman
The Pac-Man projects were developed for Berkeley CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don’t focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

These projects were designed with three goals in mind. The projects allows us to visualize the results of the techniques we implement. They also contain code examples and clear directions, but does not force us to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

There are 4 parts in this project:
1. Search in Pacman:
   Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
2. Multi-agent Search in Pacman:
   Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
3. Reinforcement Learning:
   Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook’s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
5. BNs and HMMs (Ghosbusters):
   Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implemented exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
